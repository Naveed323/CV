    <p>I am an enthusiastic, goal orientated Engineer and Teacher.
      I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. My Engineering major and working 4 years as a
      Teacher full and part time in both one-on-one and classroom based
      scenarios, Language collaboration boot camps and volunteering in
      outreach programs in Cape Town, South Africa has given me the
      critical analytical tools to assess the learners ability, their style of
      learning and motivating factors to fully tweak their inner potential.
